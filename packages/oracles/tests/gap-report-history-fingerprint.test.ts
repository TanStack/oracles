// The generator rule (coordinator decision, 2026-11-13): a new field of the
// gap oracle's history grammar is drawn last, so a fixed seed keeps the
// history it had. fast-check draws a record's fields in order, so a field
// inserted before another changes every later field's draws, and a fixed
// seed's counterexample, reach, and replay no longer mean what they did.
// This canary draws the first histories of the fixed seed and compares each
// field's fingerprint with the committed lists (history-fingerprint.json),
// whose first fields are main's: once for the drawn record, and once for
// the histories that the oracle takes, after the grammar's own mapping, so
// a mapping that folds a new field into an old one shows too. A new field
// goes at the end of the grammar and gets its own line at the end of each
// list; no earlier line changes. It guards the fields' draws, not the
// resolved plans: a new field may still change what a plan does (the plan
// takes `laterSteps` after a history's steps). The default fixed-seed
// campaign draws 2 histories, and those resolve as on main.
